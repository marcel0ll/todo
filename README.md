# TODO - a simple task tracking

This script is used to simplify my own local task tracking

Each day you have a TODO list and for each project you have another.

- Add task: `todo add [project] [New task]`
- Edit tasks: `todo edit [project]`
- List tasks: `todo list [project]`
- Counts tasks: `todo count [project]`
- Task is done: `todo done [project]`
- What is the current task: `todo what [project]`

> This script can still be improved by a lot
